# Recursive Alignment via Self-Reflection: Integrating Iterative Refinement into LLM Pretraining for Enhanced Reasoning and Truthfulness

# Overview
Recursive Alignment via Self-Reflection (RASR) is a novel training framework that integrates iterative draft-critique-refine cycles directly into the pretraining process of large language models (LLMs). Unlike conventional alignment methods that apply reflection at inference time (e.g., Chain-of-Thought or AvR), RASR enables LLMs to learn self-correction as a core skill.

- Improves reasoning, truthfulness, and logical consistency
- Embeds reflection during pretraining, not post-hoc
- Uses internal critics + iterative feedback loops
- Achieves improvements with only ~15% computational overhead

# Motivation
Current LLM alignment methods rely heavily on external interventions or inference-time prompting. They:
- Lack intrinsic self-reflection capabilities.
- Struggle with truthfulness, logical consistency, and verifiable reasoning.
- Depend on hand-engineered or rigid procedures.

# Solution
RASR addresses these limitations through a modular framework comprising:

- Generator Module (GÏˆ) â€“ Produces initial drafts and refined outputs.
- Critic Module (CÏ•) â€“ Provides multi-dimensional feedback (factuality, logic, relevance).
- Reflection Controller (RÎ¾) â€“ Governs iteration termination dynamically.
- Each output undergoes recursive improvement based on internal feedback from the critic modules.

# Key Innovations
- Internal Critic Architecture: Multi-head critics that evaluate factual accuracy, logical consistency, and contextual relevance.
- Recursive Training Objective: Combines standard pretraining with reflection and critic loss terms.
- Theoretical Guarantees: Convergence proofs and truthfulness-preserving mechanisms.
- Efficiency: Reflection is trained within the model, requiring only modest overhead.
